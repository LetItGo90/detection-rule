Built a complete SIEM detection lab using Elastic Stack. Created two Windows VMs on VMware, deployed Elastic agents, and integrated MISP threat intelligence and Slack alerting. Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline to automatically push detection rules to Elastic after simulating attacks with Atomic Red Team. Extended the lab to Azure by deploying an AKS cluster and Linux VM, ran container-based attacks, and created custom detection rules for cloud threats including unauthorized root SSH access to Kubernetes nodes.
